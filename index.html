    <h2>About Me!</h2>
    <p>Hey! My name is James Quirk, and I'm originally from Little Rock, Arkansas, but I also lived in Park City, Utah, when I was in elementary and middle school. I love skiing, playing chess, and spending time with my bunny Belinda.</p>

    <h2>Work and Education</h2>
    <p>I attended Bentonville High School, where I graduated in 2021 in the top 1% of my class as a National AP Scholar and National Merit Scholar. I'm a sophomore at Dartmouth College majoring in Engineering Sciences and Computer Science with and minoring in French. I have worked as an engineering intern at the Cold Regions Research Lab in Hanover since January, 2022, specializing in surface characterization.</p>

    <h2>Skills</h2>

    <p>I'm proficient in the coding languages Python, Java, Linux, and C. I am also conversationally fluent in French and completed Dartmouth's beginner track in Japanese. I've also spent my fair share of time in the clouds as a pilot! I earned my Private Pilot's License when I was 17 years old.</p>

    <p>Here is a video of the first time I flew by myself, back when I was 16 years old!</p>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>There is nothing I love more than the simultaneous entertainment value and educational value of programming. Computer science provides me with a creative outlet for the ideas of ways to improve society that are constantly bouncing around my head. My favorite aspect of coding is the problem-solving aspect of taking on a new challenge, but it goes beyond learning; it is a means of creating an impact by minimizing inefficiencies or limiting inequity of access to resources through technology, which grows more ubiquitous each day.</p>
    <hr color="black">
    <p>I'm excited to be applying for DALI because it allows me to combine my loves for problem-solving and learning with an ability to enact change in a realm beyond Dartmouth.</p>
