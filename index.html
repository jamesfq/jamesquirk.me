    <h2>About Me!</h2>
    <p>My name is James Quirk, and I'm originally from Little Rock, Arkansas, but I also lived in Park City, Utah, from 2011 to 2015. I love skiing, playing chess, and spending time with my bunny Belinda.</p>

    <h2>Work and Education</h2>
    <p>I graduated from Bentonville High School in 2021, where I graduated in the top 1% of my class as a National AP Scholar and National Merit Scholar. 'm a sophomore at Dartmouth College majoring in Engineering Sciences and Computer Science with and minoring in French. I have worked as an engineering intern at the Cold Regions Research Lab in Hanover since January, 2022, specializing in surface characterization. You can look at my recognition for my research here:</p>

    <h2>Skills</h2>

    <p>I'm proficient in the coding languages Python, Java, Linux, and C. I am also conversationally fluent in French and completed Dartmouth's beginner track in Japanese. I've also spent my fair share of time in the clouds as a pilot!</p>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>There is nothing I love more than the simultaneous entertainment value and educational value of programming. Computer science provides me with a creative outlet for the ideas that are constantly bouncing around my head for improvement. My favorite aspect of coding is the problem-solving aspect of taking on a new challenge, but it goes beyond learning; it is a means of creating an impact by minimizing inefficiencies or limiting inequity of access to resources through technology, which grows more ubiquitous each day.</p>

    <p>I'm excited to be applying for DALI because it allows me to combine my loves for problem-solving and learning with an ability to enact change in a realm beyond Dartmouth.</p>
