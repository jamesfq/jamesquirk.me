## Welcome to my first ever website! Yay!

# Modules
This program is both an introduction to me and a demonstration of my capabilities with APIs! I employed the Intersection Observer API and Spotify API for this website. 

Note that the Spotify API has limited capabilities in this website because I can only allow users who I have approved from the website. This is not by choice, but rather because the Spotify API is either in `Development Mode` or `Extended Quota Mode`, which requires testing by the Spotify developers. As a result, the last feature of my website does not work when operated from any email address. That being said I added both the DALI contact and application email to the approval list, so if there is a Spotify account attached to either account, please give it a shot! If not, I have demonstrated the functionality of this feature in a video.

This program is decomposed into three primary modules: `index.html`, `main.css`, and `functions.js`.

**index.html** contains the code that corresponds to the layout of the webpage found at `https://jamesfq.github.io/jamesquirk.me/`.

**main.css** contains the code that corresponds to the formatting of the elements of the webpage.

**functions.js** albeit non-functioning is the module that stores the functions that are called by pressing certain buttons.
