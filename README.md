# Modules
This program is decomposed into three primary modules: `index.html`, `main.css`, and `functions.js`.

**index.html** contains the code that corresponds to the layout of the webpage found at `https://jamesfq.github.io/jamesquirk.me/`.

**main.css** contains the code that corresponds to the formatting of the elements of the webpage.

**functions.js** albeit non-functioning is the module that stores the functions that are called by pressing certain buttons.
